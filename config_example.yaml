# Example Configuration for Timetabling Scheduler
#
# This file defines constraints for the course scheduling algorithm.
# Copy this file and modify constraints as needed for your use case.

constraints:
  # Earliest class start time (HH:MM format, 24-hour)
  # Default: 08:00 (8 AM)
  # Classes starting before this time will be filtered out
  earliestStart: "08:00"

  # Latest class end time (HH:MM format, 24-hour)
  # Default: 18:00 (6 PM)
  # Classes ending after this time will be filtered out
  latestEnd: "18:00"

  # Allow sections marked as FULL (enrollment at capacity)
  # Default: false
  # If true, includes sections with current enrollment >= total capacity
  # If false, filters out full sections
  allowFull: false

  # Allow sections marked as AT_RISK (low enrollment)
  # Default: true
  # If true, includes sections with low enrollment numbers
  # If false, filters out at-risk sections
  allowAt_risk: true

  # Maximum number of valid schedules to generate
  # Default: 50
  # Scheduler stops searching after finding this many non-conflicting schedules
  # Set higher for exhaustive search, lower for faster results
  maxSchedules: 5

  # Maximum number of full sections per generated schedule
  # Default: 0 (no full sections allowed)
  # Prevents schedules with too many high-enrollment sections
  maxFullPerSchedule: 1
